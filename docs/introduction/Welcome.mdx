# Welcome to the yFiles React Organization Chart Component

Organization charts serve as invaluable tools for illustrating hierarchical structures within a company or any other entity. They offer a visual representation of relationships and reporting structures, making it easier to understand roles, responsibilities, and the overall organization's hierarchy.

Our powerful and versatile React component based on the [yFiles](https://www.yworks.com/yfiles-overview) library, allows you to seamlessly incorporate dynamic and interactive organization charts into your applications. This enhances the user experience and facilitates an intuitive exploration of complex organizational setups.

Refer to the [Getting Started](gettingstarted) section to learn how to effortlessly integrate an organization chart with our data into your React application. [Features](features) details how to customize the component.

The API documentation provides specific information about the components, e.g. the [OrgChart](../components/orgchart) component, hooks and types.
